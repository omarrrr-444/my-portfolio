            Hi, I'm John Doe! <img src="https://png.pngtree.com/element_our/20190601/ourmid/pngtree-cartoon-hard-working-boy-image_1347021.jpg" width="60px"/>

            I am currently a High School student with an aspiration to become an AI Developer. I am currently completing a course with IBM and I have been
            experienced in HTML and CSS for almost a year now. I am also skilled in several other areas such as cooking, singing, a house care. I have a
            passion for hard work and learning new skills, and have recently been honing my mathematics and programming skills. I am also extremely well versed in 
            World and American History and I make an effort to apply all my skills on a daily basis.
